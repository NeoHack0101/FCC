          fascinated by it and how it worked.
          <li><strong>1889</strong> - He met Max Talmud</li>
          Max introduced Albert to math and science. Albert was ten years old.
          <li><strong>1894</strong> - Albert finishes school</li>
          Albert finished his schooling in Munich with medical training. He
          moved to Milan with his family.
          <li><strong>1895</strong> - Goes to school in Switzerland</li>
          Albert moved to Switzerland at 16 years old to attend Aarau Cantonal
          School.

          Albert graduates at the top of his class. He was a year younger than
          the other students.
          <li><strong>1901</strong> - Hard times</li>
          Albert slacked off in further schooling, even after doing so well.
          Because of this he had a hard time finding a good job.
          <li><strong>1902</strong> - The patent office</li>
          Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his
          understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him
          happy.
          <li><strong>1905</strong> - Submits his first paper</li>
          Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It
          was the first of many.
          <li><strong>1909</strong> - A new job</li>
          After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein
          got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.
          <li><strong>1911</strong> - Attends physics conference</li>
          He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference.
          He was the youngest physicist there.
          <li><strong>1913</strong> - Theory of gravity</li>
          He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he
          worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.
          <li><strong>1919</strong> - Einstein is famous</li>
          After publishing his Theory of Relativity and correctly predicting the
          effects of a solar eclipse, Einstein's name went around the world.
          <li><strong>1922</strong> - Nobel Prize</li>
          Einstein was awarded his first Nobel Prize. He was on his way to Japan

          <li><strong>1933</strong> - America</li>
          He visited America for the first time because he feared the rising
          Nazi party in Germany.
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - War ends</li>
          World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made
          advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300
          scientific reports.
          <li><strong>1955</strong> - Einstein dies</li>
          Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.
